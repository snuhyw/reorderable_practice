# Disclaimer
This repository was created to demonstrate a specific behavior observed when using ReorderableListView in a Bloc-based Flutter web application. The intention is not to imply that there's an inherent issue with Flutter or Bloc, but rather to seek guidance or solutions on how the code can be improved or refactored to address this behavior. Any insights or contributions are highly appreciated.
